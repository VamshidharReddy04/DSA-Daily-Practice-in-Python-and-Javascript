// Graphs - Number of Islands
// Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
// Example 1:  Input: grid = [["1","1","1","1","0"],["1","1","0","1","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","0","0","0"]] Output: 1
// Example 2:  Input: grid = [["1","1","0","0","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","1","0","0"],["0","0","0","1","1"] ] // Output: 3
// Example 3:  Input: grid = [["1","1","0","1","1"],["0","1","0","1","0"],["1","1","0","1","1"],["0","0","0","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"]] Output: 4

// Different Approaches:
// 1. Depth First Search (DFS) - Time Complexity: O(M*N), Space Complexity: O(M*N) in worst case
// 2. Breadth First Search (BFS) - Time Complexity: O(M*N), Space Complexity: O(min(M,N))
// 3. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) - Time Complexity: O(M*N*Î±(M*N)), Space Complexity: O(M*N)
// Solution 1: Depth First Search (DFS)

// Test cases

console.log(numIslands([["1","1","0","0","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","1","1","1"],["0","0","0","1","1"]])); // Output: 2
console.log(numIslands([["1","1","0","1","1"],["0","1","0","1","0"],["1","1","0","1","1"],["0","0","0","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"]])); // Output: 4

// Best Approach: Depth First Search (DFS)
